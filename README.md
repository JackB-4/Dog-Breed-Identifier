# Dog-Breed-Identifier
Overview:
This Dog Breed Identification Model is a machine learning tool designed to identify dog breeds from images. It is based on the ResNet50 architecture, a deep learning model pre-trained on ImageNet and fine-tuned on the Stanford Dog Breed Dataset, which includes around 20,000 images across 120 breeds.

Model Architecture:
The model leverages the ResNet50 architecture, known for its deep layers and efficacy in image classification. The fine-tuning process on the Stanford Dog Breed Dataset adapts the pre-trained network to specialize in dog breed identification, enhancing its performance on this specific task.

Dataset:
The Stanford Dog Breed Dataset comprises approximately 20,000 images of 120 dog breeds. This dataset is used to fine-tune the model, enabling it to learn and distinguish between a wide variety of dog breeds accurately.

Usage:
The model is designed to take an image of a dog as input and output the predicted breed. It can be integrated into various applications requiring breed identification, providing insights based on visual data.

Technical Details:
Base Model: ResNet50 pre-trained on ImageNet.
Fine-Tuning: Conducted on the Stanford Dog Breed Dataset.
Output: Predicts one of the 120 dog breeds.
This model serves as a tool for identifying dog breeds, useful in various domains requiring understanding and analysis of dog breed characteristics from images.
